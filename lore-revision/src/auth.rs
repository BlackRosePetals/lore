/////////////////////////////////
// General Notes for Auth token handling

// Check Token Recipient:
// An attacker sets up a URC repository on their own server, where their server environment info
// has the epic-controlled URC Auth service as the auth provider.
// An end user goes to clone the repository and the CLI dutifully uses the auth provider
// it is told to get an AuthN token (or loads a token from cache), and then subseqently sends it on to the attacker's server.
// Tokens should only be given to domains listed in the token's audience field
